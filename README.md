# PayloadSiteForHackers
This is a site I made for easily hosting tools and payloads over apache2 on Kali Linux so they are always ready to go. This is a time saver for me personally. I know my payloads and tools are always available to me.

To have the apache2 web server start with your Kali distro issue the below command.
```bash
systemctl enable apache2
```

Start apache2 manually using
```bash
systemctl start apache2
```
This git repo should have all these files unloaded into the /var/www/html directory. This is where the files are expected to be downloaded from.

The site looks like this. Change it however you want.

Use this in whatever way you see fit as long as it is done legally. This is just an ease of use tool I can access from anywhere.
